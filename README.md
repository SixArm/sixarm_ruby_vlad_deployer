## Introduction

Vlad is an excellent deployment tool for Ruby On Rails projects.

Read about deployment with Vlad:

What we like about Vlad:

  * Pragmatic application deployment automation.
  * Like Capistrano yet with 1/10th the complexity.
  * Uses the right tool for the job: ssh, rsync, rake.
  * Exec remote commands on one or more servers.
  * Syncs files to one or more servers.
  * Can combine local and remote tasks.
  * Test driven design. Runs incredibly fast.

This repository has our annotated Vlad deploy file. It is open source and you can customize it however you like.
